# Mina Decentralized Price Feed Oracle

This is the main repo for hosting `Price Feed Oracle API` & `Price Feed Oracle zkApp`

Decentralized Price Feed Oracle is basically a set of nodes, communicate with each other to aggree on a price for asset, than collectively sign the price and return. This implementation is limited with 5 nodes, but it can be changed and also became PoS network. 

After the result, the signatures can be verified on-chain, and the price can be used in any DeFi application, trustlessly.
